# Cancer-prediction-using-Machine-learning

The breast cancer dataset from sklearn is used.
The aim is to develop a model that can assist in the diagnosis of breast tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on features extracted from tumor biopsies.
Following ML algorithms are used to predict the result from the dataset: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier
